    <p>We sell thermite. Thermite might sound scary, but it can actually be a lot of fun and easy to control. There is a lot of talk about thermite being able to melt through steel beams and safes, but in reality it is more like a typical ground firework.</p>
    <p>Buy some today! the current price is $7 for 500g of thermite + an ignitor. Please email <a href="brubakerpreston@gmail.com">brubakerpreston@gmail.com</a> to place an order.</p>
